# Disclaimer
Use at your own risk. If you are silly enough to expose this to the internet then that's on you

It accepts any SSH key and any username, it was not created with security in mind, it's a little fun game because I got bored

It's probably got some bugs and issues too, the hitboxes on the paddles aren't the greates and the "AI" component likes to have its moments


# Usage
install the npm libraries with `npm install`

run the server with `node pong.js`

ssh to the server with `ssh -p 2244 anyusername@whateverip`

enjoy your game of pong!

# Docker
coming soon, probably
